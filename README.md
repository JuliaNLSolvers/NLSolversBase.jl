# Purpose

The package aims at establishing common ground for [Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl), [LineSearches.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/LineSearches.jl), and [NLsolve.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLsolve.jl). The common ground is mainly the types used to hold objective related callables, information about the objectives, and an interface to interact with these types.

## NDifferentiable
There are currently three main types: `NonDifferentiable`, `OnceDifferentiable`, and `TwiceDifferentiable`. There's also a more experimental `TwiceDifferentiableHV` for optimization algorithms that use Hessian-vector products. An `NDifferentiable` instance can be used to hold relevant functions for

 - Optimization: $F : \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$
 - Solving systems of equations: $F : \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^N$

The words in front of `Differentiable` in the type names (`Non`, `Once`, `Twice`) are not meant to indicate a specific classification of the function as such (a `OnceDifferentiable` might be constructed for an infinitely differentiable function), but signals to an algorithm if the correct functions have been constructed or if automatic differentiation should be used to further differentiate the function.

## Automatic differentiation

Some constructors for `OnceDifferentiable`, `TwiceDifferentiable`, `OnceDifferentiableConstraints` and `TwiceDifferentiableConstraints` accept a positional argument called `autodiff`.
This argument can be either:

- An object subtyping `AbstractADType`, defined by [ADTypes.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ADTypes.jl) and supported by [DifferentiationInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/DifferentiationInterface.jl).
- A `Symbol` like `:finite` (and variants thereof) or `:forward`, which fall back on `ADTypes.AutoFiniteDiff` and `ADTypes.AutoForwardDiff` respectively.
- A `Bool`, namely `true`, which falls back on `ADTypes.AutoForwardDiff`.

When the positional argument `chunk` is passed, it is used to configure chunk size in `ADTypes.AutoForwardDiff`, but _only_ if `autodiff in (:forward, true)`.
Indeed, if `autodiff isa ADTypes.AutoForwardDiff`, we assume that the user already selected the appropriate chunk size and so `chunk` is ignored.

## Examples
#### Optimization
Say we want to minimize the Hosaki test function

$$f(x, y) = (x^2 + y - 11)^2 + (x + y^2 - 7)^2$$

The relevant functions are coded in Julia as
```julia
function f(x)
    a = (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4)
    return a * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
end

function g!(G, x)
    G[1] = (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8)* x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
    G[2] = 2.0 * (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * x[2] * exp(-x[2]) - (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
end

function fg!(G, x)
    g!(G, x)
    f(x)
end

function h!(H, x)
    H[1, 1] = (3.0 * x[1]^2 - 14.0 * x[1] + 14.0) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
    H[1, 2] = 2.0 * (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8.0) * x[2] * exp(-x[2])  - (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8.0) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
    H[2, 1] =  2.0 * (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8.0) * x[2] * exp(-x[2])  - (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8.0) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
    H[2, 2] = 2.0 * (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * exp(-x[2]) - 4.0 * ( 1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 *  x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * x[2] * exp(-x[2]) + (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
end
```
The `NDifferentiable` interface can be used as shown below to create various objectives:
```julia
x = zeros(2)
nd   = NonDifferentiable(f, x)
od   = OnceDifferentiable(f, g!, x)
odfg = OnceDifferentiable(f, g!, fg!, x)
td1  = TwiceDifferentiable(f, g!, h!, x)
tdfg = TwiceDifferentiable(f, g!, fg!, h!, x)
```
#### Multivalued objective
If we consider the gradient of the Himmelblau function above, we can try to solve $\nabla F(x) = 0$ without caring about the objective value. Then we can still create `NDifferentiable`s, but we need to specify the cache to hold the value of $\nabla F(x)$. Currently, the only relevant ones are `NonDifferentiable` and `OnceDifferentiable`. `TwiceDifferentiable` could be used for higher order (tensor) methods, though they are rarely worth the cost. The relevant functions coded in Julia are:

```julia
function f!(F, x)
    F[1] = (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8)* x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
    F[2] = 2.0 * (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * x[2] * exp(-x[2]) - (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
end

function j!(J, x)
    J[1, 1] = (3.0 * x[1]^2 - 14.0 * x[1] + 14.0) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
    J[1, 2] = 2.0 * (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8.0) * x[2] * exp(-x[2])  - (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8.0) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
    J[2, 1] =  2.0 * (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8.0) * x[2] * exp(-x[2])  - (x[1]^3 - 7.0 * x[1]^2 + 14.0 * x[1] - 8.0) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
    J[2, 2] = 2.0 * (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * exp(-x[2]) - 4.0 * ( 1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 *  x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * x[2] * exp(-x[2]) + (1.0 - 8.0 * x[1] + 7.0 * x[1]^2 - (7.0 / 3.0) * x[1]^3 + (1.0 / 4.0) * x[1]^4) * x[2]^2 * exp(-x[2])
end

function fj!(F, G, x)
    g!(G, x)
    f!(F, x)
end
```
The `NDifferentiable` interface can be used as shown below to create various objectives:
```julia
x = zeros(2)
F = zeros(2)
nd   = NonDifferentiable(f!, x, F)
od   = OnceDifferentiable(f!, j!, x, F)
odfj = OnceDifferentiable(f!, j!, fj! x, F)
```

## Interface

To extract information about the objective, and to update given some input, we provide a function based interface. For all purposes it should be possible to use a function to extract/update information, and no field access should be necessary. Actually, we proactively discourage it, as it makes it much more difficult to make changes in the future.

### Single-valued objectives 
To retrieve relevant information about single-valued functions, the following functions are available where applicable:
```julia
# obj is the objective function defined as shown above
value(df)       # return the objective evaluated at df.x_f
gradient(df)    # return the gradient evaluated at df.x_df
gradient(df, i) # return the gradient evaluated at df.x_df
hessian(df)     # return the hessian evaluated at df.x_h
```
To update the various quantities, use:
```julia
# obj is the objective function defined as shown above
value!(df, x)     # update the objective if !(df.x_f==x) and set df.x_f to x
value!!(df, x)    # update the objective and set df.x_f to x
gradient!(df, x)  # update the gradient if !(df.x_df==x) and set df.x_df to x
gradient!!(df, x) # update the gradient and set df.x_df to x
hessian!(df,x)    # update the hessian if !(df.x_df==x) and set df.x_h to x
hessian!!(df,x)   # update the hessian and set df.x_h to x
```

### Multivalued 
To retrieve relevant information about multivalued functions, the following functions are available where applicable:
```julia
# obj is the objective function defined as shown above
value(df)    # return the objective evaluated at df.x_f
jacobian(df) # return the jacobian evaluated at df.x_df
jacobian(df) # return the jacobian evaluated at df.x_df
```
To update the various quantities, use:
```julia
# obj is the objective function defined as shown above
value!(df, x)     # update the objective if !(df.x_f==x) and set df.x_f to x
value!!(df, x)    # update the objective and set df.x_f to x
jacobian!(df, x)  # update the jacobian if !(df.x_df==x) and set df.x_df to x
jacobian!!(df, x) # update the jacobian and set df.x_df to x
```

## Special single-function interface
In some cases the objective and partial derivaties share
common terms that are expensive to calculate. One such case is if
the underlying problem requires solution of a model or simulation
of a some system. In that case the `only_fg!`/`only_fj!` and `only_fgh!`
interfaces can be used.

### Example
Say we have some common functionality in `common_calc(...)` that is used
in both the objective and partial derivative. Then we might construct a
OnceDifferentiable instance as
```julia
function f(x)
    common_calc(...)
    # calculations specific to f
    return f
end
function g!(G, x)
    common_calc(...)
    # mutating calculations specific to g!
end
OnceDifferentiable(f, g!, x0)
```
However, in many algorithms `f` and `g!` are evaluated together, so the
common calculations are done twice instead of once. We can use the special
interface as shown below.
```julia
function fg!(F, G, x)
    common_calc(...)
    if !(G == nothing)
        # mutating calculations specific to g!
    end
    if !(F == nothing)
        # calculations specific to f
        return f
    end
end
OnceDifferentiable(only_fg!(fg!), x0)
```
Notice the important check in the `if` statements. This makes sure that `G` is only
updated when we want to, and, if only `G` is to be updated, that we don't calculate 
the objective.
